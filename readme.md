`Bike Share Data`
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent/borrow a bike from point A and return it at point.By accessing access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. This service provides a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, I use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

`The Datasets`
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)

End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)

Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)

Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)

End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)

User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender

Birth Year

`Statistics Computed`
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

`1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)`
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

`2 Popular stations and trip`
most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

`3 Trip duration`
total travel time
average travel time

`4 User info`
counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
